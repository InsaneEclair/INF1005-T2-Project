                    Albino Red Eared Sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) are one of the most striking of all turtles to keep as pets, their survival in the wild is almost impossible.
                    Luckily a few breeders, produce them for keepers to appreciate and enjoy. Albino Red Ears behave the same as normal Red Eared Sliders. 
                    All our turtles are healthy, active and feeding on commercial pellets.
